# CLAUDE.md

Paseo is a mobile app for monitoring and controlling your local AI coding agents from anywhere. Your dev environment, in your pocket. Connects directly to your actual development environment — your code stays on your machine.

**Supported agents:** Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode.

## Repository map

This is an npm workspace monorepo:

- `packages/server` — Daemon: agent lifecycle, WebSocket API, MCP server
- `packages/app` — Mobile + web client (Expo)
- `packages/cli` — Docker-style CLI (`paseo run/ls/logs/wait`)
- `packages/relay` — E2E encrypted relay for remote access
- `packages/desktop` — Electron desktop wrapper
- `packages/website` — Marketing site (paseo.sh)

## Quick start

```bash
npm run dev                          # Start daemon + Expo in Tmux
npm run cli -- ls -a -g              # List all agents
npm run cli -- daemon status         # Check daemon status
npm run typecheck                    # Always run after changes
```

See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for full setup, build sync requirements, and debugging.

## Critical rules

- **NEVER restart the main Paseo daemon on port 6767 without permission** — it manages all running agents. If you're an agent, restarting it kills your own process.
- **NEVER assume a timeout means the service needs restarting** — timeouts can be transient.
- **NEVER add auth checks to tests** — agent providers handle their own auth.
- **Always run typecheck after every change.**
